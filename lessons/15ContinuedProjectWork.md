Verify that your app works and all of the project requirements are met.For the coding assignment this week, submit a link to your final project repo, not a PR. Reviewers will engage with you on Slack if the project needs revisions.

## Project Demo Details

It is good practice to talk about what you have learned and know about project as you will be asked to talk about your experiences in job interviews. This is why we ask all students to give a short demo of their final projects. This **demo is NOT graded and your performance in the demo will have no bearing on your graduation**. Please record a 3-5 minute presentation that touches on all of the following:

 - [ ] Provide a quick overview of the app
 - [ ] Demonstrate your app's functionality
 - [ ] Show any additional features of the app such as pagination, search functionality, or anything you may have included
 - [ ] Share what the most challenging part of the project and what you enjoyed working on the most or answer any of the following questions:
   - [ ] Did you encounter any problems? How did you resolve them? What resources did you use?
   - [ ] What did you have the most fun building?
   - [ ] Did you reach your end goal?
   - [ ] How would you want to continue your project and grow it further? 

## How to Record Your Presentation

You can record your presentation in any of these three ways:
 1. Logging into your personal Zoom account and record your personal meeting where only you are in attendance and you are screen-sharing your work ([this is a link to a video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwbjFYCbGU))
 2. Use a screen recording program already on your machine
	- [Mac users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Byefp51tY)
	- [Windows users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJB7pM5bvNI)
 3. Use an online option such as loom ([link to a how to video on loom here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAdLPbfXcQo)).

If you're nervous about recording, remember that the folks watching are here to support and champion you (and likely have had to do one of these too at some time!) so they'll understand nerves and forgive mistakes. Here is a great [video on public speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q074YSGwRTM)
If you're worried about messing up, here is a great [video on failure](https://tekkieuni.com/blog/failure-in-coding-is-a-good-thing/)

Both of these videos will set you up for success and may help you feel more comfortable with your presentation.  Reach out to mentor and classmates if you need moral support or a practice audience!
